# Tuples in python:

- Unlike Lists,  Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
- Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.
- Tuples can be nested, meaning they can contain other tuples as elements.
- Tuples are faster and more memory-efficient than lists.
